n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		fP-BPL6iRu2tbcvlnjRshw		4		60 beers on tap ... what else do i need to say ? <sssss> ok - ill say more . <sssss> they are on the second floor at cityscape downtown and the bar has a enclosed patio area that overlooks the downtown area . <sssss> the inside bar has live bands , open mic , and jazz on different nights of the week . <sssss> more of an upscale bar that a business person goes to after work with friends i wouldnt categorize this as a `` night club '' . <sssss> again 60 beers on tap .

n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg		2		i want to start off with saying that everytime i drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big , plain , white building , i always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground . <sssss> it 's totally not . <sssss> it is like a rich texan 's house inside . <sssss> cow rug , leather , old cowboy photos on the wall . <sssss> so the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel . <sssss> we got sat in the main dining room and i also want to add like i felt like the place was `` dusty '' i do n't know why , or what made me feel this way , but `` dusty '' was what i got from the place . <sssss> i ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad . <sssss> travis got a burger with fries . <sssss> so - my ribs were just `` okay '' and my potatoes were super super garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated . <sssss> they came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes . <sssss> like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square . <sssss> the square was small , but actually i did n't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much . <sssss> oh ! <sssss> and `` cole-slaw '' my other side i ordered was `` cole-slaw '' . <sssss> notice how i put '' '' around this word `` cole-slaw '' . <sssss> i do that because it was n't cole-slaw at all !?!?!? <sssss> it was literally just shredded up dry cabbage !?!??! <sssss> so ... yeah , did n't eat the slaw . <sssss> we finished our meals and got up to see their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900 's so the bar was very cool . <sssss> go for a drink at the bar . <sssss> i would n't do dinner again .
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw		4		this place has a really chill , almost a hipster feel to the place -lrb- normal for downtown phx -rrb- . <sssss> all the servers are `` cool '' and no one is in a big hurry . <sssss> we split this steak sandwich with fries and we also split a flight of 6 beers to get an idea of what we 'd order as our `` real '' drink . <sssss> i ended up ordering the old chub -lrb- scottish ale -rrb- and it was dark and amaze balls . <sssss> i enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so i would say the quality is good -lrb- a little bland but nbd -rrb- instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend . <sssss> i personally would have just enjoyed the ketchup . <sssss> someone dropped a glass and i swear they swept for like 20 minutes -lrb- hipster slow -rrb- the bathrooms are unisex and clean but -- it smelt like piss in there ... i dunno i think the urinal might be the culprit . <sssss> we bought travis a shirt -lrb- the restaurant 's logo is pretty badass -rrb- and supposedly he got the last xl men 's tee so that made us a little giddy . <sssss> there are 31 craft beers on tap and i am a huge fan of craft beers . <sssss> we will be back .
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		UL3OMN_c-NXHlyb97pDifA		3		what can i say ... ... it 's a good place to get beer . <sssss> if you go into your dinning experience knowing that it is a chain restaurant , then you wo n't be disappointed . <sssss> next time i 'll just stick to the beer .
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w		4		great service and the food was spiced perfectly ... better than most any other restaurant than i have ever been to . <sssss> the eggs puzzle me though . <sssss> they cook their eggs on way too high of heat on the morning that i was there . <sssss> i literally could n't cut through the eggs with a fork . <sssss> when i brought it to the servers attention she gladly brought me back a reorder , but the reorder only had 1 egg versus 2 . <sssss> the reordered egg was still inedible from being fried on way too high of heat . <sssss> everything else was fantastic . <sssss> oh , and did i mention really hot servers ?
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA		4		i love the feel of this place as soon as you walk in . <sssss> i have always found the staff to be very friendly and the food and wine are great . <sssss> i have been to italy at least 7 times and the pizza here is as authentic as it gets ! <sssss> i would recommend ... . <sssss> hang on ... . <sssss> are you ready for this ? <sssss> the vegetarian pizza with sausage added . <sssss> i know , i know ... there is a reason for this . <sssss> the veggies on this pizza are carmelized . <sssss> carmelized veggies and sausage are sent from heaven . <sssss> it is a great place for a casual date night .
WWxCMDn8rVHIrIFoKRcRDg		CV4DDFG6tII-ehzaWPXK4g		4		yesterday my wife and i both had a `` half '' of the roasted sweet potato sandwich , which normally comes with `` roasted sweet potato , fresh mozzarella , fig confit , tomato , arugula , marinated fennel and balsamic vinaigrette on herb focaccia '' . <sssss> obviously , we get it without the mozzarella , and it 's fantastic ! <sssss> the half sandwich is still big , do n't know if i could eat a whole one . <sssss> we also both got a bowl of the vegetarian chili , which is vegan . <sssss> it was also fantastic . <sssss> lots of vegan bread options and otherwise -lrb- hummus plate , salads , etc -rrb- . <sssss> i appreciate that they use a wide variety of unique ingredients , veggies & herbs , that you do n't normally find at most other restaurants . <sssss> we 'll definitely be frequenting wildflower more often now .
WWxCMDn8rVHIrIFoKRcRDg		TgxDGx7L_JICWbuBUCGVqw		4		the curious case of the disappearing review . <sssss> i 'm sure i 've reviewed fajita 's before , but it seems to have vanished . <sssss> fajita 's has some spectacular lunch specials . <sssss> i give them 5 full stars for their lunch , not so much for dinner -lrb- much more pricey -rrb- , which some how i 've determined equals out to 4 stars . <sssss> so , go there for lunch , munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap . <sssss> being a vegetarian , i thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $ 5 . <sssss> they make their own in house tortillas , which are unique and very good . <sssss> they also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer . <sssss> awesome lunch spot .
