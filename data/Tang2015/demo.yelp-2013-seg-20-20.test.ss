n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		1eJiyKXx_ruNu6F36BJQCg		4		we love mojo ! <sssss> its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy ! <sssss> a minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and i 've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with the idea others have done the same ... aka - possible human debris and hair in my yogurt !
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		xxyuGOeAWnKVwIfoKnfUNA		4		this is a casual spot to eat with friends before going out into old town . <sssss> servers are hit or miss but just this last visit our server was very flexible with the menu and willing to change/add things to make us happy . <sssss> they recently added sushi to the menu which was odd to my friends since the place is a chinese restaurant . <sssss> i really did n't care and just ordered 2 rolls which were pretty good ! <sssss> the spicy tuna was `` meh '' and the crouching dragon roll was deelish ! <sssss> love edamame and the server suggested some sauce but gave it on the side `` in case '' i did n't like it - but it was really good , so glad she offered it ! <sssss> the half portions are very large so no need to order the whole size unless your sharing . <sssss> they do n't have sapporo light which kinda sucks because of the extra calories . <sssss> great open bar and cool happy hour spot .

n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		Nq7eB1wB2EArUICtiNePvQ		2		we went for lunch and i made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a smithwicks because i was craving them . <sssss> the fiance -lrb- yes , we 're engaged ! <sssss> -rrb- ok , so he ordered a burger and kiltlifter . <sssss> the food came and my tacos were whack -lrb- duh - i should have known better ! <sssss> -rrb- and travis 's burger was bomb . <sssss> it had a fat onion ring in it and thick cut bacon . <sssss> i ate more of his than mine . <sssss> besides all that , our server was crappy . <sssss> she never came around to ask if we wanted another round of brews ... lame . <sssss> as a pub - they should be bringing barrels to us . <sssss> the bill was $ 50.00 . <sssss> the end .
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		cN6aBxe2mQvrQlzk26LyRQ		5		from beginning to the end , durants was flawless . <sssss> no windows in the place , and red booths fill the room . <sssss> a large inviting bar , and old rat pack feel from the place . <sssss> if i could afford to dine here often i would be one fat and happy girl .
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		9VZ_imQjvgtpt3k6W6AQ_A		3		my wife really wanted to come here . <sssss> i used to think this was the best in town , but things have changed . <sssss> it seems like every time i walk away from here my thoughts are on `` i just paid $ ... for that ! '' <sssss> it seems like prices went up and quality went down when they opened at the biltmore . <sssss> i guess they have to cover that rent with higher prices .
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw		5		just wonderful ! <sssss> i love the coffee here . <sssss> the atmosphere is war and friendly . <sssss> a lot of friendly people hanging out .
ziCKT5n58tcVfgksImx0VQ		DjdA1xbHki_lopCSxf-Egg		4		these 4 stars are all based on expectations . <sssss> what do you expect when you go to greasewood flats ? <sssss> what are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating ; picnic tables ; open fire pits ; horseshoe pitches ; donkeys ; roosters ; one man band ; limited food menu ; serves only beer and sodas ; and is filled with bikers , cowboys and lesser so tourists . <sssss> this is everything that you expect from greasewood flats . <sssss> the atmosphere is so relaxed that i think you would be hard pressed to find a more caasual environment . <sssss> everyone is just having a good time hanging out with friends . <sssss> the green chile and bacon cheeseburger is a great idea , but the only way they cook the burgers is to medium . <sssss> medium is overcooked in my book and the medium that i got was actually well done . <sssss> again , it 's about expectations . <sssss> i came here to hang out with friends and family and enjoy the day .
WWxCMDn8rVHIrIFoKRcRDg		c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA		4		the food & beverages at moto are awesome . <sssss> the service needs a little help , as they do n't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill . <sssss> they might just need more staff . <sssss> i award 4 stars because i know i will be back for the beer and food . <sssss> awesome selection of craft brews on tap , only $ 3/glass during happy hour -lrb- 3pm - 6:15 pm -rrb- . <sssss> cheap appetizers during happy hour too . <sssss> win ! <sssss> numerous veggie choices -lrb- that are actually good -rrb- . <sssss> the wonton nachos minus meat were awesome . <sssss> the tofu yakisoba was awesome . <sssss> the veggie rolls were awesome . <sssss> i wish this place was closer to my house .
WWxCMDn8rVHIrIFoKRcRDg		93hdmjYc8IXsf69VrkRHog		4		what a breath of fresh fresh air . <sssss> the owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them . <sssss> how awesome is that ? <sssss> regarding the rice , apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed . <sssss> the owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie ! <sssss> they 're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it 's delicious ! <sssss> the pitas contain no dairy , which is awesome . <sssss> this place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs . <sssss> definitely recommend that you check this place out !
