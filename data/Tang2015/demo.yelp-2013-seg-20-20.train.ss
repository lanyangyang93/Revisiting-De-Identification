n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		1ggcLvWPBDWnp5MVTRnoRg		1		i 'm convinced everywhere i go sucks . <sssss> this place was at the chandler mall . <sssss> nice ambiance inside and family oriented . <sssss> the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever . <sssss> the marinara sauce did n't have any spices or hint of authentic italian to it . <sssss> the whole menu is literally spaghetti so do n't go with the idea of getting any other kind of italian dish . <sssss> the meatballs same thing . <sssss> no big italian taste or spiciness . <sssss> the appetizer - the artichoke dip was bland . <sssss> felt like old people food or kid friendly food . <sssss> nothing for your palette to discover . <sssss> very blah . <sssss> just save your money and go to oregano 's where your never disappointed i guess .
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		sgBl3UDEcNYKwuUb92CYdA		5		my mom took me here and we were the only non-asian people in the place so we were very excited . <sssss> it was not very busy but it was during the week so maybe that was the reason . <sssss> we ordered hot green tea to start with then i ordered the won ton soup and my mom ordered a dinner special that was chicken chow mien with friend rice , 2 crab puffs , and 1 egg roll -lrb- i ate the crab puffs :-d -rrb- . <sssss> my won ton soup was huge and absolutely delicious !! <sssss> i want to tell the world about this place to share it 's deliciousness . <sssss> it had wontons , chicken , shrimp , and steak pieces all inside this soup . <sssss> i could n't finish it all and packed the leftovers for the bf to enjoy . <sssss> i 'll be back -lrb- arnold voice -rrb- .
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		NcAI7SE1SNlrOEfFg9Wzuw		2		we went in around 830pm on a friday night and it was very quiet inside . <sssss> we asked about any dj or live music and the bartenders explained that they have a dj but not sure when they were coming in . <sssss> we had a couple of drinks and hung out for about 45 min . <sssss> and still no music . <sssss> this bar has so much potential with it 's awesome location within the historical hotel san carlos . <sssss> i was so disappointed to not have it be more lively or organized enough to have a dj that comes in a specific time each night on the weekends . <sssss> prices were average for the bar . <sssss> it felt like this place has n't been updated in a while and there is like a huge bubble lamp with a hot pink light inside ... ... the cool part is the chandeliers and the `` vip '' section that looks like my grandma 's living room .
n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg		m9haUi2_1lHR2eAKBhKwDg		3		we had a reservation on a sunday and they sat us right away which was nice since it was packed . <sssss> it was open kitchen and we could see the brick oven cooking all the pizzas . <sssss> i ordered a wine cooler since they are pretty popular as it was very strong and refreshing . <sssss> we ordered a chop salad to split and it was one of the best chop salads we had ! <sssss> wish it was larger since our split portion of the meatball was on the smaller side . <sssss> pizza was good . <sssss> service could have been way better also .
